  <h4 class="pageTitle" style="color: #2c3e50;"> Call for Submission </h4>
Do you wonder how we can rigorously evaluate and effectively regulate rapidly emerging AI technologies?<br>
  Are you working on building evaluation frameworks or tackling the regulatory challenges of deploying AI in clinical practice?<br>
  Are you developing methods to ensure that AI models are not just innovative, but also safe, reliable, and ready for real-world use?<br><br>

  <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0;">
    Then BRIDGE is the right place for your work!
  </div><br>  

  This workshop is dedicated to connecting the fast-moving world of AI innovation with the rigorous demands of evaluation and the growing challenges of AI regulation.<br>
  As technologies such as generative AI and autonomous agents continue to evolve at an accelerating pace, regulatory bodies face a pressing question:<br>
 <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 10px 0;">
    how can we regulate what we donâ€™t yet know how to evaluate?
  </div><br>

  BRIDGE offers a collaborative forum for researchers, clinicians, and regulators to explore how we can better align technical development with robust evaluation methods and regulatory standards. We welcome contributions that address theoretical, empirical, or conceptual aspects of regulatory science.<br><br>

  <h4>Topics of Interest:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Proposals for robust evaluation frameworks or regulatory frameworks.</li>
    <li>Papers highlighting the disconnect between AI development, evaluation metrics, and regulatory science.</li>
    <li>Theoretical or empirical studies identifying gaps between current evaluation practices for medical AI and regulatory requirements.</li>
    <li>Novel algorithmic approaches designed with regulatory alignment in mind.</li>
    <li>Perspective or position papers addressing open problems, negative results, or flawed practices in AI development that affect regulatory alignment and patient safety.</li>
    <li>Evaluation and regulation of cutting-edge technologies like generative AI, LLMs, and autonomous systems, particularly in clinical or high-stakes environments.</li>
    <li>Post-market monitoring and regulation: ensuring AI systems remain safe and effective after deployment.</li>
    <li>Empirical studies assessing AI readiness for clinical deployment.</li>
    <li>Underexplored regulatory questions with direct implications for patient safety.</li>
  </ul><br>

  We welcome any submission at the intersection of medical AI evaluation and regulatory science.<br><br>

  <h4>Submission Evaluation Criteria:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Topic Appropriateness:</strong> Does the paper explore evaluation of AI technologies, regulatory science, or related challenges? Is it relevant to patient safety, challenges of real-world deployment, or AI regulatory challenges?</li>
    <li><strong>Clarity and Structure:</strong> Is the paper logically structured, clearly written, and accessible to a multidisciplinary audience?</li>
    <li><strong>Empirical Quality (for empirical papers):</strong> Does the work measure or validate new or existing concepts in a robust and rigorous way?</li>
  </ol><br>
